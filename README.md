# STM32-NUCLEO-F401RE-HelloWorld


This project demonstrates a simple "Hello, World!" program running on the STM32-Nucleo-F401RE microcontroller board. The program uses the UART communication interface to print the message over serial communication.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine and run it on the STM32-Nucleo-F401RE board.

### Prerequisites

- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) installed for project development.
- STM32-Nucleo-F401RE microcontroller board.
- USB-to-Serial adapter (if not already built into the Nucleo board).

 Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.

### Usage

1. Connect the STM32-Nucleo-F401RE board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Build and flash the project to the board using STM32CubeIDE.
3. Connect the UART TX pin (PA2) of the Nucleo board to your computer's UART RX pin using a USB-to-Serial adapter.
4. Open a terminal program (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term) on your computer with the appropriate UART settings (baud rate, data bits, etc.).
5. Power up the Nucleo board.
6. You should see the "Hello, World!" message printed in the terminal.
